This repository includes the replication code for the estimation of:

- The baseline DSGE model of "Investment Shocks and Business Cycles," by Justiniano, Primiceri, and Tambalotti (JPT)
- Development of the JPT model to include two agents, H and S, switching between a "hand-to-mouth" and unconstrained state, as in Bilbiie (2019).
