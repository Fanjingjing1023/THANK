- `JPT`: The baseline DSGE model of "Investment Shocks and Business Cycles," by Justiniano, Primiceri, and Tambalotti.
- `THANK`: Development of the JPT model to include two agents, H and S, switching between a "hand-to-mouth" and unconstrained state, as in "Monetary Policy and Heterogeneity: An Analytical Framework," by Bilbiie (2019).
